Models a four-bar linkage in Simscape Multibody.  The lengths
of the links are parameterized using MATLAB variables.  Adjusting
those lengths enables the tip of the four-bar linkage to follow
different trajectories. Using optimization algorithms, the
lengths can be automatically tuned so that the tip follows a 
desired trajectory.
